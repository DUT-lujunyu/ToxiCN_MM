## üìú Chinese Harmful Meme

To adapt to the Chinese online environment, we introduce the definition of Chinese harmful memes:

>_**Chinese harmful memes are multimodal units consisting of an image and Chinese inline text that have the potential to cause harm to an individual, an organization, a community, a social group, or society as a whole.** 
These memes can range from offense or joking that perpetuate harmful stereotypes towards specific social entities, to memes that are more subtle and general but still have the potential to cause harm. 
It is important to note that Chinese harmful memes can be created and spread intentionally or unintentionally. **They often reflect and reinforce underlying negative values and cultural attitudes on the Chinese Internet, which are detrimental from legal or moral perspectives.**_


## üìú ToxiCN MM

According to the definition, we identify the most common harmful types of memes on Chinese platforms, including **_targeted harmful_**, **_general offense_**, _**sexual innuendo**_, and _**dispirited culture**_.
We focus on these harmful types when constructing the dataset.

During the annotation, we label memes from two aspects: **_harmful types_** (i.e., the above four types) and **_modality combination_** (i.e., analyzing toxicity through fused or independent features, including _Text-Image Fusion_, _Harmful Text_, and _Harmful Image_)
